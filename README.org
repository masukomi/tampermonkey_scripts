#+title: Readme

This repo contains the many [[https://www.tampermonkey.net/][Tampermonkey]] scripts I use to make the web less crappy.

The vast majority of them are compensating for web sites that weren't tested with large font sizes. This typically results in text being cut off, or so much clutter that there isn't much space left for the content.

Some screenshots with examples of the type of stuff these do:

Fixing the unusably small search field on [[https://thangs.com][thangs.com]]

Making the main body of GitHub wider so that you can see more of code examples.

Removing the useless right sidebar on [[https://stackoverflow.com][StackOverflow]] & expanding the questions and answers into the newly available space.

Making daring fireball's tiny central column be an actually useful width.

That and many more.
